## ✨ Why Orbit?

- **🔧 Simple API**: Quickly set up scheduled jobs using clean and intuitive methods.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Leverages Go's concurrency model to run thousands of tasks effortlessly.
- **📈 Built-In Monitoring**: Track job execution in real-time with built-in monitoring hooks.
- **🔒 Safe & Reliable**: Robust error handling and recovery, so your tasks always stay healthy.
- **🎯 Flexible Scheduling**: Supports interval-based and cron-based scheduling.

## 📦 Installation

Simply install with:

```bash
go get github.com/osmike/orbit
```

## 🚦 Quick Start

Here's how easy it is to get started:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/osmike/orbit"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    orb := orbit.New(ctx)

    pool, _ := orb.CreatePool(ctx, orbit.PoolConfig{
		// MaxWorkers sets the maximum number of concurrent workers allowed to execute jobs simultaneously.
		// Higher values can improve throughput for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks, but might consume more system resources.
		// Default value:
		MaxWorkers: 1000,
		// IdleTimeout specifies the duration after which a job that remains idle
		// (not executed or scheduled for immediate execution) will be marked as inactive.
		// This helps optimize resource usage and prevents accumulation of stale tasks.
		// Default value:
		IdleTimeout: 100 * time.Hour,
		// CheckInterval defines how frequently the pool checks for jobs that are ready for execution or require status updates.
		// Short intervals result in more responsive job execution at the expense of slightly increased CPU utilization.
		CheckInterval: 100 * time.Millisecond,
    }, nil)

    jobCfg := orbit.JobConfig{
        ID:   "hello-world",
        Name: "Print Hello World",
        Fn: func(ctrl orbit.FnControl) error {
            fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
            return nil
        },
        Interval: orbit.IntervalConfig{Time: 5 * time.Second},
    }

    orb.AddJob(pool, jobCfg)
	// Run starts the main controlling goroutine for the pool.
	// It continuously manages job scheduling, execution, and lifecycle events.
    pool.Run()

    select {} // Keep running indefinitely
}
```

## 🛠 Features

- **Concurrency Control**: Limit how many jobs run simultaneously.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Customize behavior with hooks (`OnStart`, `OnSuccess`, `OnError`, etc.).
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retry failed tasks.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures tasks are safely terminated without losing data.
